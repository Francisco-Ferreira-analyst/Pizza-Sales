# 🍕 Pizza Sales Dashboard

### 📊 Business Intelligence Case Study

A local pizzeria has experienced steady growth in both online and in-store orders, but the management team lacked a centralized view of performance data. Key decisions, such as staffing, promotions, and menu updates — were being made without supporting data.

This case study focuses on building a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that gives real-time insights into sales performance and customer behavior, helping the business make smarter, data-driven decisions.

The dashboard is designed to help answer:

- What are the busiest days and hours for orders?
